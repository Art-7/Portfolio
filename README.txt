Thank you for taking the time to view my repository!

I have collected in this repository a collection of projects I have coded that show a range of skills that I have developed.

As long as required tools to run various projects are installed, they all will run as intended. 

NOTE:
The Python projects are best run from a command line or terminal.
Running directly through Windows does cause the program to close immediately after execution, making it impossible to see the outputs for projects that are not persistent.

Project descriptions:


Faucet_fixer
********************
coded text based app that can manage customer faucets installed in their home. 
Can also be used to diagnose various product failures and return list of parts needed to repair the product.
Prototyped as proof of concept for mobile app or chat bot functionality to allow customers to self service faucets with simple problems, automate warranty part ordering, and gather basic information for customer service reps in situations where code could not resolve issue
Full version would determine part numbers, considering age of product and finish. Would also be able to determine if case demanded human attention.

Arena (WIP)
********************
Contains the Beast battler game, which allows 2 teams of creatures to battle eachother. 
replicates UI and style of a SNES era RPG game such as Final Fantasy, but only with monsters for now.
uses HTML and CSS to create UI and uses Javascript to control the Canvas HTML element to render the main game screen
Full version to feature basic progression, balanced creatures and abilities, status effects and an AI opponent. 



SQLite

World Population Queries 1
********************
Use SQL queries to find data and answers to a series of questions on a world population database.
Reason:
More advanced use of basic queries, pulled a few operations and functions from web as well for questions that wanted answers like a max or a differnence in data.
Questions posed are commented out in the file.
Bonus- found out nesting a query within a query is perfectly legal.

World Population Queries 2
********************
Use SQL queries to find data and answers to a series of questions on a world population database.
Reason:
Similar to the first part, however this time the data was split among a couple of tables that had to be correctly linked via JOIN

Web Design

Excursion
********************
Created landing page for new app.
Had to take a mock up of the page and build an HTML structure that contained all the parts of the page.
Followed up by styling elements to get page to match requested result.
Also published page using GitHub pages at https://art-7.github.io/excursion/
